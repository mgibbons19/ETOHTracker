ICONS NEEDED FOR PWA
====================

You need to create two icon files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

EASY OPTIONS:
-------------

Option 1: Use an Emoji
- Open any design tool (Canva, Figma, etc.)
- Use a glass emoji 🍷 or 🍺
- Export as PNG at the sizes above

Option 2: Simple Design
- Solid color background (e.g., #2563eb - the app's blue)
- White letter "D" for Drinks in the center
- Clean, minimal design

Option 3: Online Generators
- Use tools like:
  - favicon.io (can generate from emoji)
  - realfavicongenerator.net
  - iconifier.net

Once created, place both files in the root directory:
- icon-192.png
- icon-512.png

The app will work without these, but they're needed for:
- Home screen icon when installed
- App launcher icon
- Notification icons
- Professional appearance
